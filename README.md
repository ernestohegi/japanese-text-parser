> 💭 **よちむ (Yochimu)** means "prophetic dream" in Japanese. This tool was created to help Japanese language learners efficiently study vocabulary in context.

## 🚀 What is Yochimu?

Yochimu is a powerful tool designed for Japanese language learners who want to study vocabulary **in context** rather than in isolation. Unlike traditional vocabulary lists or flashcards, Yochimu allows you to work with real Japanese sentences, preserving the context that is crucial for proper language acquisition.

With Yochimu, you can:

- 🔍 Search for any Japanese word or phrase
- 📚 Get authentic example sentences with translations
- 💾 Save your favorite sentences for study
- 📤 Export to Anki-compatible format for spaced repetition practice

## ✨ Features

### 🇯🇵 Search in Japanese

Enter any Japanese word or phrase and get detailed translations and example sentences. Yochimu tokenizes your input and finds relevant, natural sentences.

### 🔖 Save Your Favorites

Collect useful sentences by clicking on them, building your personalized study list as you explore.

### 📝 Export to Anki

Download your saved sentences as a TSV file that can be easily imported into Anki for spaced repetition practice.

## 🧠 Why Context Matters

Learning words in isolation makes it difficult to understand how they're actually used in real Japanese. Yochimu focuses on providing complete sentences so you can learn:

- 🌟 Natural word usage
- 🔄 Common collocations (words that often appear together)
- 📏 Grammatical patterns
- 🏮 Cultural context

This approach leads to better retention and more natural Japanese expression.

Yochimu is built with modern web technologies:

- ⚛️ **React.js** - For building the user interface

- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** - For styling
- 🇯🇵 **Wanakana** - For Japanese text processing
- 🔄 **React Query** - For efficient data fetching
