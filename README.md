# Japanese Text Parser
## Work In Progress

Given a file with text in Japanese, it returns a list of words along with their definitions and translations.

# Installation guide

Requirements are `Node.js` and `npm` installed. I'm using `yarn` for managing dependencies but you can use whatever system you want. Some technical knowledge is required as well.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `yarn install` or `npm install`.

# Dependencies

This parser is using [Kuromoji](https://github.com/takuyaa/kuromoji.js) library to tokenise Japanese text.

Given this is a work in progress, as of version 0.1.0, I haven't decided yet which dictionary and translator to use.

頑張ってください！
